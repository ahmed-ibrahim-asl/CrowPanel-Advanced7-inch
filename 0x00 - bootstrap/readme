# Phase 0: Workspace Setup

Before writing any code, this phase focuses on preparing a **stable and comfortable development environment**.

You can choose **one of two paths**, depending on how deep you want to go:

| Choice | Description |
|:------:|-------------|
| 🔵 **Blue Pill** | **Fast onboarding**<br>Ideal for beginners who want to start coding immediately |
| 🔴 **Red Pill** | **Deep understanding**<br>Best for learners who want full control and insight |

## 🔵 Blue Pill — *Just Get Me Started*

If your goal is to **start coding as quickly as possible**, this is the recommended path.

### Why we using platform IO for Blue Pill path !?

- Initial setup with the **Arduino IDE** was unreliable
- Using AI tools (e.g. Copilot) inside Arduino IDE felt limiting

Thats why we used **PlatformIO** instead of **Arduino-IDE**.



### ✅ Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] Install **Visual Studio Code**
- [ ] Install the **PlatformIO** extension
- [ ] Install squareLine Studio 1.4.0
- [ ] Open the provided **template project**
- [ ] Start developing immediately

## 🔴 Red Pill — *Walk Me Through Every Detail*

Choose this path if you want a deep understanding of the development environment.
We will eventually use the Blue Pill folder for a faster workflow, but the goal here is to fully understand the environment first.

### What this path covers

- Will explain the why and the what behind each part of the setup.
- We will focus into breaking and understanding more than just get it done.

## ❓ Questions

### 1. What is LVGL?
**LVGL** (short for **Light and Versatile Graphics Library**) is an **open-source UI framework** used to build **graphical user interfaces on embedded systems**.


### 2. What is SquareLine Studio?
**SquareLine Studio** is a **UI design tool** that generates **LVGL-compatible code**.  
It does not replace LVGL, it works on top of it.


### 3. Why install SquareLine Studio version 1.4.0?
Any SquareLine Studio version that can export **LVGL 8.3.x** is technically valid.

Version **1.4.0** is used because:
- It matches the **LVGL version used in Elecrow examples**
- It avoids version mismatch confusion during setup


> **Note:** Next Section is Break Down for Library folder.

### 4. What is the Adafruit BusIO library responsible for?
**Adafruit BusIO** is a low-level helper library that simplifies I2C and SPI register access for **Adafruit hardware drivers**.

- It does not control hardware by itself
- It is only a dependency for other Adafruit libraries
- It is not used by LVGL or LovyanGFX


### 5. What is the Adafruit GFX Library responsible for?
**Adafruit GFX** provides basic 2D drawing primitives (text, lines, shapes) for Adafruit display drivers.

- Used by Adafruit OLED/TFT libraries
- Not used by LVGL
- Not used by LovyanGFX


### 6. What is the I2C_BM8563_RTC library responsible for?
**I2C_BM8563_RTC** is a driver for the **BM8563 real-time clock (RTC)** chip.

- Handles date and time keeping
- Communicates over I2C
- Independent from display and UI logic


### 7. What is the LovyanGFX library responsible for?
**LovyanGFX** is the display driver layer that communicates directly with the **RGB LCD hardware**.

- Configures RGB timings
- Manages frame buffers and DMA
- Controls backlight PWM or enable pins



### 8. What is the LVGL library responsible for?
**LVGL** is the UI framework responsible for:

- Widgets (buttons, labels, sliders)
- Layouts and styles
- Touch events and screen logic



### 9. What is the TAMC_GT911 library responsible for?
**TAMC_GT911** is the touch controller driver for the **GT911 capacitive touch IC**.

- Reads touch coordinates over I2C
- Detects press/release and multi-touch
- Supplies data to LVGL input callbacks



### 10. What is the TCA9534 library responsible for?
**TCA9534** is a driver for an **I2C GPIO expander**.

- Often used to control:
  - LCD backlight enable
  - Power or reset lines
- Required only if your board routes these signals through the expander


### 11. What is `lv_conf` responsible for?
`lv_conf` is the LVGL configuration file.

- Enables or disables LVGL features
- Sets memory limits and color depth
- Must match display resolution and RAM constraints

## Next Steps

Once your workspace is ready, continue to the next phase of the project.
